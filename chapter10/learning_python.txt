Python is a high-level and general-purpose programming language. As this definition implies, you can use Python for several purposes, from web development to data science, machine learning, and robotics. Python’s real-world use cases are limitless.

You’re probably wondering what people are successfully building with Python. If you take a quick look at companies using the language, then you’ll find world-class companies, such as Google, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, Netflix, and more.

Google has used Python from the start, and it’s gained a place as one of the tech giant’s main server-side languages. Guido van Rossum, Python’s creator, worked there for several years, overseeing the language’s development.

Instagram likes Python for its simplicity. The service is known for running “the world’s largest deployment of the Django web framework, which is written entirely in Python.”

Spotify uses the language for data analysis and back-end services. According to its team, Python’s ease of use leads to a lightning-fast development pipeline. Spotify performs a ton of analysis to give recommendations to its users, so it needs a productive tool that works well. Python to the rescue!

You’ll also find that Python has been vital for science and space exploration, with a lot of exciting use cases in robotics and hardware control.
